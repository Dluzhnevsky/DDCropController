# DDCropController

## Description
DDCropController is my take on a simple yet somewhat complicated task of cropping the UIImage to a defined asepct ratio.

## Usage
Create a controller, passing the image and the aspect ratio and prepare to listen for its delegate meethod on completion.

Controller supports all combinations of both original image and crop rect's aspect ratios, which, as I've found out thae hard way, is not the case in most of the other existent solutions.

The 'Cancel' and 'Crop' button texts can be provided on controller's creation for the localization and customization purposes. Otherwise the fallback generic English strings will be used instead.

Controller was designed to be simplistic and lightweight, with no storyboards and XIBs, and with minimum excessive layouting.
